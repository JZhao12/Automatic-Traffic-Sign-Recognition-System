Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire. I'm now working on a project related to object real-time characterization and manipulation, which could be applied on robotics and automation.

This is my undergraduate final year project: Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system in Real-time. Traffic sign recognition is a real-world problem. When people drive cars on the road, sometimes it will be difficult for people to keep their eyes everywhere at the same time. The reason for doing this project is to reduce the chance of not noticing speed limit changes or potential hazard warnings by implementing a TSR system.
