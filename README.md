# Automatic-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-(TSR)-System-in-Real-time
This is my final year project, there are 12 MATLAB code files including 4 help functions and 8 scripts.

## Help functions:
1. createLgraphUsingConnections
2. findLayersToReplace
3. freezeWeights
4. helperCIFAR10Data

## Scripts:
1. 'DataVisual' is used to do data visualization
2. 'DoubleTheImbalancedData' is used to do data augmentation.
3. 'Getcifar-10Data' is used to get the CIFAR-10 dataset.
4. 'imageAugmentation' did a lot of thing. It is used to do image augmentation, rotation, remove the black background, create traffic sign shapes.
5. 'previewDatastore' is used to preview the images after image augmentation
6. 'RealtimeRecognition' is used to implement the TSR system in real-time and record the processing speed
7. 'shapeAugment' is used to genrate shapes do the image augmentation to the created shapes
8. 'traffic' is used to import images,specify the network,do 5-fold cross validation, configure the training options and train the network.
