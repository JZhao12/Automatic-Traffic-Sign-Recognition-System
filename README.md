# Automatic-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-(TSR)-System-in-Real-time
This is my final year project, there are 12 MATLAB code files including 4 help functions and 8 scripts.

## Help functions:
1. createLgraphUsingConnections
2. findLayersToReplace
3. freezeWeights
4. helperCIFAR10Data

## Scripts:
1. 'DataVisual' file is used to do data visualization
2. 'DoubleTheImbalancedData' file is used to do data augmentation.
3. 'Getcifar-10Data' file is used to get the CIFAR-10 dataset.
4. 'imageAugmentation' file did a lot of thing. It is used to do image augmentation, rotation, remove the black background, create traffic sign shapes.
5. 'previewDatastore' file is used to preview the images after image augmentation
6. 'RealtimeRecognition' file is used to implement the TSR system in real-time and record the processing speed
7. 'shapeAugment' file is used to genrate shapes do the image augmentation to the created shapes
8. 'traffic' file is used to import images,specify the network,do 5-fold cross validation, configure the training options and train the network.
